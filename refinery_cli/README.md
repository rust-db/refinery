## Installation

Windows binaries are static executables. Users of platforms not explicitly
mentioned below are advised to download one of these archives.

### Debian/Ubuntu

If you're a **Debian** user (or a user of a Debian derivative like **Ubuntu**),
then ripgrep can be installed using a binary `.deb` file provided in each
[refinery_cli release](https://github.com/rust-db/refinery/releases/).

```sh
$ curl -LO https://github.com/rust-db/refinery/releases/download/0.8.4/refinery_0.8.4_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i refinery_0.8.4_amd64.deb
```

### Arch Linux

If you're an **Arch Linux** user, then you can install
the [`refinery_cli`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/refinery_cli) package from AUR:

```sh
$ yay refinery_cli
```

### NixOs

If you're a **Nix** user, you can install ripgrep via
the [`refinery-cli`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/tools/refinery-cli/default.nix) package:

```sh
$ nix-env -iA refinery-cli
```

### Cargo.

If you're a **Rust programmer**, `refinery_cli` can be installed with `cargo`.


```sh
$ cargo install refinery_cli
```

## Usage

Setup your database type and access credentials with `setup`.

```sh
$ refinery setup
```

After that, just run your migrations giving your config file with `-c` flag (by defaults it is the `refinery.toml` generated by the setup) and migrations dir with `files -p $dir`.

```sh
$ refinery migrate -c sqlite_refinery.toml -p ./sql_migrations
```

### Running via database uri

To run migrations from a database [uri](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) (like: postgres://user_name:passwd@hostname:5432/myDB ) stored in an environment variable DB_URI.

```sh
$ refinery migrate -e DB_URI -p ./sql_migrations
```

This option is also useful when running refinery inside a docker container, where you usually have the db connection info stored as an environment variable.

For more info and migration options run.

```sh
$ refinery migrate --help
```
